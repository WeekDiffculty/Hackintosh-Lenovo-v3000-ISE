Change log：13/2/2018

•I have done this SSDT-HACK.aml，now all DSDT patches can be replaced by this except battery patch，I'm not going to add a    battery patch to SSDT-HACK at the moment.

•This SSDT-HACK.aml can fix Audio、HD5500 Graphics、USB has injected properly、Brightness、XCPM mode、OS check.

•Note:I still use the RMCF to control these hotpatches,because it will be convenient for me to debug. 
It is best to use it after the installation is completed.
